Regression Testing: Performed thorough testing after code changes to verify sustained functionality.
Test Case Design and Execution: Created and executed test cases to validate user interfaces, payment gateways, and product listings.
Bug Reporting and Collaboration: Reported bugs discovered during testing and collaborated with developers to resolve them effectively.
Deliverables (Optional):

This repository could potentially house test plans, test cases, and bug reports associated with the project (depending on the chosen format).
This project demonstrates my commitment to delivering high-quality e-commerce experiences through meticulous SQA practices.
