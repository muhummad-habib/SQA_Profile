# Test Plan: Amazon Web Login Functionality
This document outlines a test plan for evaluating the login functionality of a hypothetical Amazon Web application. It serves as a guide for executing test cases and ensures a comprehensive login process evaluation.

1. Introduction

Project: Amazon Web Login Testing
Date: (Insert current date)
Tester: (Your Name)
Scope: This test plan focuses on the login functionality of the Amazon Web application. It encompasses scenarios involving valid and invalid credentials, password reset functionality, and error handling.
2. Test Objectives

Verify successful login with valid user credentials.
Ensure proper error messages are displayed for invalid login attempts.
Test the functionality of the password reset process.
Evaluate system behavior under different browser and device combinations (if applicable).
3. Test Environment

Application URL: (Insert application URL here)
Browser: (Specify browsers targeted for testing)
Operating System: (Specify operating systems targeted for testing)
Hardware: (Specify hardware requirements for testing)
4. Test Data

The test plan should include a table outlining various test data sets used for login scenarios. This might include:

Valid usernames and passwords
Invalid usernames and passwords (e.g., empty username, incorrect password)
Non-existent usernames
Usernames with special characters
5. Test Cases

The test plan should reference the detailed test cases documented separately. Each test case should include:

Test case ID
Description
Preconditions
Test steps
Expected results
Pass/Fail criteria
6. Pass/Fail Criteria

A test case passes if the actual results match the expected results.
A test case fails if the actual results deviate from the expected results or an unexpected error occurs.
7. Reporting

A test report will be generated upon test case execution, summarizing the results (passed, failed, and inconclusive).
The report will detail any identified bugs or defects for further investigation by the development team.
8. Schedule

(Insert estimated timeline for test case execution and reporting)
9. Risks and Mitigations

Identify potential risks associated with testing (e.g., application downtime, incomplete test data).
Define mitigation strategies to address these risks (e.g., scheduling tests during maintenance windows, gathering additional test data).
10. Approvals

(Name and Title) - Test Lead (or equivalent)
